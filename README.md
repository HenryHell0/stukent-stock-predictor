# Stukent Stock Predictor

## What is this?

This is a stock prediction application I made for my financial literacy class. The companies in the mock investment simulation have fake names, but they correlate with the stock history of actual companies.

Some of them were quite obvious, like Swoosh Athletics = Nike and Corner Drug Store = CVS. But there are still a few companies I haven't been able to trace back to their real world equivalent.

## How do I use this?

1. Go to <https://flitb8.web.app/>
2. Look at the predicted stock prices
3. Go to Money Management > Investments in Stukent
4. Invest accordingly

## Important Notes

This will not work for every iteration of the Stukent Stock Predictor. You can still see which companies are which, but your simulation likely starts on a different date.
